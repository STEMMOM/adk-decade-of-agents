title: Minimal Agent Cell
arc: decade-of-agents
status: active

description: >
  Build the smallest executable agent cell: a minimal agent with identity,
  instructions, a single execution path, and a tool interface that calls Gemini once.
  This is not a chatbot demo, but the structural origin of the P01–P10 agent system.

# Structure Card fields (aligned with your 6-field structure format)
structure_card:
  name: P01 — Minimal Agent Cell
  goal: >
    Create the first “living” agent unit that can perform one complete
    thought–action cycle via Gemini, with a clear separation between Agent,
    Tool, and Model.
  input:
    - user_question: "A real-world question (e.g., 'What happened in AI this week?')"
    - env:
        - GOOGLE_API_KEY from Google AI Studio
        - GEMINI_API_KEY from Google AI Studio
  mechanism: >
    Initialize a MinimalAgent with name, instructions, and model; route user
    input through run_once(), which calls ask_gemini() as a tool wrapper
    around client.models.generate_content(...), then return the model's answer.
  conditions:
    - Python virtualenv .venv is activated at repo root
    - google-genai is installed in the .venv
    - .env exists at repo root and is loaded into the shell
    - A test call returning 'API_OK' has succeeded
  output:
    - console_log:
        - "[P01] Minimal Agent Cell Demo"
        - "User: <question>"
        - "Agent: <Gemini answer text>"
    - a verified, runnable agent execution loop using Gemini

notes:
  - >
    This project intentionally avoids UI, frameworks, or complex tooling.
    It is the cleanest possible expression of an “agent cell” that later
    projects can extend with sessions, observability, memory, tools, routing,
    governance, and self-evolution.
  - >
    The key conceptual distinction: P01 defines a minimal Agent/Tool/Model
    structure, whereas a chatbot is just a prompt → model → text loop.
