# RRB (Repo Release Bot) — Intent-Governed Release (Skeleton)

RRB defines a governance-first release flow:  
Intent → Policy Eval → DecisionRecord → History (append-only) → Optional Execute.

Relation to Partition Constitution: RRB relies on gate tests and append-only history to enforce constitutional release boundaries.
